Os aplicativos web progressivos usam APIs web modernas, juntamente com a estratégia tradicional de aprimoramento progressivo para criar aplicativos web entre plataformas. Esses aplicativos funcionam em todos os lugares e fornecem vários recursos que lhes dão as mesmas vantagens de experiência do usuário que os aplicativos nativos. Este conjunto de médicos diz tudo o que você precisa saber sobre eles.

## PWA advantages

PWAs should be discoverable, installable, linkable, network independent, progressive, re-engageable, responsive, and safe. To find out more about what these mean, read [Progressive web app advantages](/pt-BR/docs/Web/Apps/Progressive/Advantages). To find out how to implement PWAs, consult the guides listed in the below section.

## Core PWA guides

The following guides show you what need to do to implement a PWA, by examining a simple example and showing you how all the pieces work.

1. [Introduction to progressive web apps](/pt-BR/docs/Web/Apps/Progressive/Introduction)
2. [Progressive web app structure](/pt-BR/docs/Web/Apps/Progressive/App_structure)
3. [Making PWAs work offline with Service workers](/pt-BR/docs/Web/Apps/Progressive/Offline_Service_workers)
4. [How to make PWAs installable](/pt-BR/docs/Web/Apps/Progressive/Installable_PWAs)
5. [How to make PWAs re-engageable using Notifications and Push](/pt-BR/docs/Web/Apps/Progressive/Re-engageable_Notifications_Push)
6. [Progressive loading](/pt-BR/docs/Web/Apps/Progressive/Loading)
