This page contains multiple tutorial series that highlight different workflows for effectively creating different types of web games.

- [2D breakout game using pure JavaScript](/pt-BR/docs/Games/Workflows/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript)
  - : In this step-by-step tutorial you'll implement a simple breakout clone using pure JavaScript. Along the way you will learn the basics of using the {{htmlelement("canvas")}} element to implement fundamental game mechanics like rendering and moving images, collision detection, control machanisms, and winning and losing states.
- [2D breakout game using Phaser](/pt-BR/docs/Games/Workflows/2D_breakout_game_Phaser)
  - : In this step-by-step tutorial you'll implement the same breakout clone as the previous tutorial series, except that this time you'll do it using the[Phaser](http://phaser.io/) HTML5 game framework. This idea here is to teach some of the fundamentals (and advantages) of working with frameworks, along with fundamental game mechanics.
- [2D maze game with device orientation](/pt-BR/docs/Games/Workflows/HTML5_Gamedev_Phaser_Device_Orientation)
  - : This tutorial shows how to create a 2D maze game using HTML5, incorporating fundamentals such as collision detection and sprite placement on a {{htmlelement("canvas")}}. This is a mobile game that uses the [Device Orientation](/en-US/Apps/Build/gather_and_modify_data/responding_to_device_orientation_changes) and [Vibration](/pt-BR/docs/Web/Guide/API/Vibration) **APIs** to enhance the gameplay and is built using the [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) framework.
- [2D platform game with Phaser](https://mozdevs.github.io/html5-games-workshop/en/guides/platformer/start-here/)
  - : This tutorial series shows how to create a simple platform game using [Phaser](http://phaser.io/), covering fundamentals such as sprites, collisions, physics, collectables, and more.
